#summary How to setup the Bullet physics engine for the samples provided by Wire3D.
#labels Deprecated

Some of the samples use Bullet 2.77, which can be downloaded [http://code.google.com/p/wire3d/downloads/list here]. Download the appropriate version for the target platform which you want to build for. The sample project files expect the following directory structure:

{{{
bullet-2.77
bullet-2.77-wii
Wire3D
Wire3D/Samples
Wire3D/Wire
...
}}}

Bullet for Wii contains pre-built library files.


For Windows you have to build the library files yourself and put them in the `bullet-2.77\lib\Debug` and `bullet-2.77\lib\Release` directory respectively.

Detailed information on Bullet can be found [http://bulletphysics.org here].
