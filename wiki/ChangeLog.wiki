#summary ChangeLog of released versions.

== v1.0.2 (`rxxx`) ==
  * Wire
    * draw call batching of static and dynamic geometry
    * text rendering
    * skybox node
    * `VertexBuffer` uses 32bit color (instead of 4 floats) now, so no more conversion at Bind() time. *Note*: Although interface changed, there are no changes for the user due to implicit conversion operators to/from ColorRGB(A).
    * `IndexBuffer` only uses 16bit indices, as Wii does not support 32bit indices anyways. *Note*: Interface only changed on `IndexBuffer::GetData()`, if you are accessing index buffers via operator[] there are no changes necessary.
    * (PC) fixed renderer statistics bug when `ResetDevice()`/`DestroyAll()` was issued.
    * (PC) fixed NVIDIA PerfHUD getting stalled when pressing a key.
    * (Wii) fixed anisotropic texture filtering

  * Tools:
    * [http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/index.html freetype2] font engine added

  * Importer
    * leaking vertex data fixed
    * support for "Static" flagged transformations
    * fixed missing Spotlight parameters

== v1.0.1 (`r407`) ==
  * Wire
    * debug build uses custom operator new/delete
    * unified handling of platform dependent index buffers
    * fixed `ResetDevice` issue when `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` objects are used 

  * Importer
    * turned importer into lib
    * handle render states that are defined per material (additionally to per node/leaf defined render states)
    * handle vertex and index buffer access usage types
    * keep record of number of imported materials, textures, nodes, geometries, vertex buffers, index buffers
    * fixed memory leak

  * Tools
    * added Bullet Physics lib to solution for wii and win32
    * added Unity3D exporter
    * fixed 3rd party lib gcc warnings
